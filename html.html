<h1 class="journeytext">My Journey with HTML</h1>

<br>

<br>

<h3 class="text" style="font-family: 'Arima Madurai', cursive;">This page will tell you all about my journey with HTML, including the tools I used, tips and tricks I learned along the way, and what helped me the most. Obviously, I am still learning how to code, so the advice will be very basic and perfect for peole who are learnig how to code, like me! <br> <br>
Before the fall 2021, I had no idea what coding really was or anything about it. <br> <br>I have learned so much in my mediaPRO 303 class. My professor did a great job introducing us to the many tools we would be using. I also found a lot of help through Free Code Camp, W3 Schools, and YouTube videos. <br> <br>
I like coding because it is something you can learn on your own and you can go at your own pace. I do admit, sometimes I want to throw my computer at a wall when something isn't working, but the most rewarding feeling is figuring out how to do something after many failed attempts.
